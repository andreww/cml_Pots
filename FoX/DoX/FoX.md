## Introduction

* [Versioning](|Versioning|)

* [Configuration and compilation](|Compilation|)

* [Embedding into an existing project](|Embedding|)

## API documentation

* FoX has four sets of publically exported interfaces. These are documented here:

### COMMON interface

* [FoX_common](|FoX_common|)

### OUTPUT interfaces

* [FoX_wxml](|FoX_wxml|)
* [FoX_wcml](|FoX_wcml|)

### INPUT interface

* [FoX_sax](|FoX_sax|)

These documents describe all publically usable APIs.

If a subroutine or function, or indeed one of its arguments, is not mentioned above, it is not to be considered part of the stable API, even if it is accessible.

The astute developer is reminded that all times the final reference documentation is the source, which is publically available.
