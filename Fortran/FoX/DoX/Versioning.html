<h1>FoX versioning</h1>

<p>This documentation describes version 2.1 of the FoX library</p>

<p>FoX was originally based on the version 1.2 of the <a href="http://lcdx00.wm.lc.ehu.es/ag/xml/">xmlf90</a> library, but has since evolved heavily.</p>

<p>This release version includes output modules for general XML, and for CML, and also a Fortran version of the SAX2 input parser interface</p>

<p>This is a stable branch, which will be maintained with important bugfixes, but on which no further major development will occur.</p>

<p>Version 2.1 has support for outputting complete XML documents, with support for all XML objects described in XML11, and XML Namespaces. A detailed description of its precise conformance level is in the WXML documentation.</p>

<p>In addition, there is a large suite of routines available for outputting valid <a href="http://www.xml-cml.org">CML</a> documents.</p>

<p>There is also a SAX input module, compatible with the SAX 2 standard - pprecise conformance details listed in the SAX documentation.</p>

<p>Input modules are under development for DOM and XPath, and will be released with a later version.</p>
