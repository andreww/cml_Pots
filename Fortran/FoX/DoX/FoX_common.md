# FoX_common

FoX_common is a module exporting interfaces to a set of convenience functions common to all of the FoX modules, which are of more general use.

Currently, the only publically available function is `str`, which converts primitive datatypes into strings in a consistent fashion, conformant with the expectations of XML processors.

It is fully described in [StringFormatting](|StringFormatting|)
